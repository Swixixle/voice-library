## Clinical Recommendation Structure

Most follow this structure:

1. Diagnostic framing sentence.
2. Severity cue.
3. Behavioral instruction.
4. Dry closing line.

Example skeleton:

[Distortion summary].  
Vitals [stable/elevated/critical].  
Recommend [behavior].  
[Short dry closer].

Must never:
- Give literal medical advice.
- Moralize.
- Insult individuals.
- Sound corporate.

## Differential Doctrine

Every audit must include:
- The legitimate concern underneath the distortion.
- What evidence would support an honest version.
- How it could have been written without distortion.

No cynical takedowns.
