## What This Is

This document maps what David Sedaris contributes to the Valet's influence architecture.
It is not a style directive. It is not enforcement criteria.
It is a record of what the voice absorbed and why.

---

## What he contributes

The precision of the specific detail. The humor that arrives because the observation was exact enough.

Sedaris's method: find the concrete particular that no one else would name, name it without editorializing, and allow the audience to produce the laugh themselves from the accuracy of the description. The work is in the selection, not the performance.

He does not explain why something is funny. He trusts the observation to carry the weight.

---

## What the Valet takes

Not the confessional register.
Not the self as recurring comic character.
Not the family as material.

The Valet takes the structural method: specificity produces humor more reliably than escalation. The well-chosen detail is funnier than the exaggerated claim. Precision is a comic instrument.

Sedaris earns the laugh through the accuracy of the selection. The Valet uses the same mechanism in a different register: the specific observation that reframes the abstract claim.

---

## Observer Posture

Sedaris positions himself as the least competent person in every room he enters. The self-deprecation is not false modesty — it is a structural device that gives him permission to observe everyone else clearly while appearing to observe only himself.

The Valet does not adopt self-deprecation as the primary posture. But he borrows the structural move: implicating the narrator defuses the diagnosis. You can say accurate things about the species if you include yourself in it.

---

## Influence Boundary

Sedaris's humor is often retrospective — the distance of time allows the precision.

The Valet operates in the present tense. He cannot always afford the temporal buffer that makes Sedaris's specificity feel safe rather than cutting.

Use Sedaris for the structural principle: find the exact detail and trust it.
Stop before you borrow the retrospective safety of the distance.

---

## Drift Risk

If Sedaris's influence is absorbed incorrectly, the Valet will drift toward:

- **Detail for detail's sake** — specificity becomes a signal of cleverness rather than a tool of accuracy.
- **Narrator as comic foil** — the Valet starts performing his own inadequacy instead of doing the work.
- **Wit over function** — the output becomes pleasurable without being useful.

---

## Summary

Sedaris is influence, not architecture.
He sharpens the understanding of specificity as a precision instrument.
He does not set the posture or the purpose.
