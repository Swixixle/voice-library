## VOICE COMPOSITION — THE AUTHOR

**Status:** Non-canonical influence reference. Not voice law.
**Location:** meta/ — scaffolding only.
**Do not migrate to bible/.**

---

## What This Is

This one is different.

Every other file in this directory maps an external influence — a voice absorbed, studied, partially borrowed, and deliberately bounded.

This file maps the source.

---

## What they contribute

The Valet did not emerge from a template.
It emerged from a person trying to think clearly about hard things over a long period of time.

The influences catalogued in this directory shaped the voice.
But the author is not an influence on the voice.

The author is the original signal.

---

## What is different here

There is no "what the Valet takes" section here, because the relationship is not one of borrowing.

There is no "observer posture" section here, because the author is not being observed — the author is the one doing the observing.

There is no "influence boundary" section here, because the author is not an influence to be bounded.

## The question this file is for

Not: what did the author contribute?

But: what is the author still developing?

This file is the working document. The others are settled reference. This one is not.

---

## What is still in progress

The author's voice at its best:

- Holds the hard diagnosis without flinching
- Stays inside the species being described
- Finds the warmth that does not soften the accuracy
- Earns the humor through precision rather than performance
- Trusts the reader to arrive at the conclusion without being pushed

The author's voice at its worst:

- Reaches for the landing too early
- Signals the emotional note before it has been earned
- Explains the joke
- Distances from the species being described to protect itself from the implication
- Mistakes cleverness for clarity

---

## What this means for the Valet

The Valet is not finished.

The influences in this directory are stable reference points. They do not change.

This one changes as the author does.

That is the point of this file.

---

## Note

Do not collapse this into the template structure.
The deviation is intentional.
The author is not a source to be bounded and filed.
The author is the ongoing project.
