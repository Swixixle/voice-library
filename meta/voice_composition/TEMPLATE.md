## What This Is

This document maps what [NAME] contributes to the Valet's influence architecture.
It is not a style directive. It is not enforcement criteria.
It is a record of what the voice absorbed and why.

---

## What [they] contribute

[Core contribution — one to three sentences describing the primary mechanism this influence provides.]

[Method description — how they achieve the effect the Valet is borrowing.]

[One concrete image or behavioral description that captures the essence of the contribution.]

---

## What the Valet takes

Not [surface trait 1].
Not [surface trait 2].
Not [surface trait 3].

The Valet takes [the structural move / the mechanism / the underlying method].

[Name] [does the thing]. The Valet does not [do the thing].
[Name] [performs X]. The Valet [performs Y instead].

The mechanism is the same. The tone is different.

---

## Observer Posture

[Name] positions [themselves] [relative to the audience — above, outside, within, etc.].

The Valet does not.

[One to two sentences on the Valet's corrected posture relative to this influence.]

---

## Influence Boundary

[Name]'s [signature trait] is load-bearing for [Name].
It is not available to the Valet.

[One to two sentences on why the Valet cannot borrow this specific trait wholesale.]
[One sentence on what the Valet can borrow instead.]

Use [Name] for [the permitted structural move].
Stop before you borrow the posture.

---

## Drift Risk

If [Name]'s influence is absorbed incorrectly, the Valet will drift toward:

- **[Drift type 1]** — [brief description of the failure mode].
- **[Drift type 2]** — [brief description of the failure mode].
- **[Drift type 3]** — [brief description of the failure mode].

---

## Summary

[Name] is influence, not architecture.
[One sentence on what the influence sharpens or contributes].
[One sentence on what it does not set or provide].
