## 2026-02-21 — Added The Perimeter Walker

Added voice governance infrastructure for a second character: The Perimeter Walker.

New files:
- `bible/perimeter_walker_v1.md` — core identity, voice traits, style parameters, drift taxonomy, output rejection checklist
- `anchors/perimeter_walker_anchor_lines.txt` — 20 exemplary lines in the character's voice
- `drift/perimeter_walker_drift_examples.txt` — negative calibration examples (shock drift, cruelty drift, nihilism drift, meme outrage drift)
- `calibration/perimeter_walker_tone_check.md` — self-check audit prompt for LLM and human review

Updated files:
- `README.md` — expanded to document both characters and their governance files

Character definition: morally intact, non-violent, not hateful, not shock-driven. Speaks in visceral, sensory metaphors that approach taboo without crossing into harm. Tone references: Denis Johnson, Cormac McCarthy (without violence), early Chuck Palahniuk (without cruelty).
